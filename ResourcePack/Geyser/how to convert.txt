Note to self:
1. Any models that will appear in GUI (hats for example) need a hand made sprite
1a. put sprites in geyser_sprites > textures > geyser > geyser_custom
1b. In the java resourcepack, include a sprites.json, and add an entry under the item type with the custom model data and sprite location from 1a
2. Archive java resourcepack, upload to site like drop box
3. Also upload the geyser_sprites.mcpack file to drop box
